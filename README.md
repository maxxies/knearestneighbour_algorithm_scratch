# knearestneighbour_algorithm_scratch
A KNearestNeighbour algorithm from coded from scratch .
- Can be used on any classification data but changes must be made to the algorithm.
- Changes to the test size and k can be changed as desired.
- Algorithm calculate euclidean distances and selects the closest to the features for prediction.
